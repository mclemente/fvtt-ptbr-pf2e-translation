However, she still harbored in her heart a fierce pride in what dwarves had accomplished. She had long fought against the cult of Droskar, seeing it as emblematic of all the worst parts of dwarven culture.</p>\n<p>By the time she infiltrated Droskar's Crucible in 4065 AR, the cult was already in decline. She knew portions of Droskar's Crucible were built by the worshippers of Torag who preceded the cult and that something of great power had been locked away in the Lower Vault, but not what that object was. If she could gain control over the cult, she could simultaneously use them to open the Lower Vault and convince them to set aside their worship of Droskar-if not for her own patron, Cayden Cailean, then any other faith with a more positive leaning.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, her attempt to seize control of the cult using their own traditions against them backfired when she succumbed to the Soul Smith. Unlike the others who were slain by the Soul Smith, Azarim's soul managed to somewhat escape being bound into the Soul Smith's soul chain by instead seeking shelter in her own magic rapier. Frustrated at the fact her soul slipped away but ignorant of where that soul fled to, the Soul Smith returned to his tasks and soon forgot about Azarim-she was, to the undead dwarf, just another in a long line of failures.</p>\n<p>Today, <em>Azarim</em> is an intelligent <em>+1 striking @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.roeYtwlIe65BPMJ1]{Shifting} rapier</em>.

The contest consists of taking turns to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.EEDElIyin4z60PXx]{Perform}, starting with your opponent. The Performance check's DC is the higher of the opponent's Perception DC or Will DC, though the two parties can mutually agree to use an impartial judge instead.

If you play the bargainer's instrument as part of your performance, it grants you a +2 item bonus to the Performance checks.</p>\n<p>After the contest, the conjured creature can choose to return to where it came from or remain where you conjured it. The loser must endeavor to complete the task by all reasonable means within 1 week. Failing to complete it is shameful but has no further consequences.

He intended for the crown to bolster his ability to rule and herald in a new era of a dwarven kingdom that followed the teachings of Droskar. Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it-not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency- if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.</p>\n<p>The crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood-the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to \"enjoy.\" Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the Crown of the Kobold King is a potent item.

      "description": "<p>Rarely found outside of major metropolises, fingerprinting kits are a state-of-the-art, non-magical means of linking suspects to the scene of a crime.</p>\n<p>The kit consists of two parts. The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a secret Thievery check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a @Check[perception|dc:15|traits:action:seek] check-the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>"

Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of Gauntlight's levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.</p>\n<p>As an artifact, Gauntlight can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>\n<p>In Gauntlight's current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below. By swapping in a series of magical lighthouse lenses that focus Nhimbaloth's baleful gaze—lenses so powerful that even Belcorra takes special care with them—the artifact gains significantly greater power, including the ability to reach all the way to Absalom and to activate its effects every minute. These lenses are described in \"Eyes of Empty Death,\" the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>To activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in \"Eyes of Empty Death\").

Once animated, the undead remain active until slain. Until then, they remain uncontrolled and are driven only by the desire to slaughter the living. If Gauntlight is fully restored, the undead instead animate as any Common undead of 15th level or less, as the user wishes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per month</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> A pale blue beam shines from Gauntlight's lens and illuminates a 30-foot-radius burst centered on any point within 1 mile.

This is a teleportation effect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> If Belcorra's ghost is permanently destroyed, Gauntlight loses all of its magical properties and collapses in on itself all the way down to its base, leaving an incredibly deep pit in the Fogfen.</p>"

Each round this effect functions, it attempts to counteract one disease or poison affecting you with a bonus equal to your class DC – 10. <em>Heartblood</em> also reduces physical signs of aging, altering your appearance to that of vigorous adulthood for your ancestry. (Non-adults who drink <em>heartblood</em> change only in apparent vigor, not age.)</p>\n<p>You have fast healing equal to half your level, as well as resistance to void damage and poison damage equal to half your level. Also, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against death, paralyze, or sleep effects as one step better.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage 2 (1 Month)</strong> You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision.

Doing so once after each time you roll initiative is enough. Your normal coloration returns for a few hours after you drink blood.</p>\n<p>If you die at this stage or higher, your body becomes a bloody mist that sinks 6 feet into the ground. The third night thereafter, you rise from the earth as a vampire with the alignment of the <em>heartblood</em>'s creator.

      "description": "<p>Resembling little more than a simple iron pipe with a handle, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> is one of the most well-known star guns in all of Arcadia. Legends state the Crowned Regent Kaldemash helped forge one of the first star guns millennia ago. While the star gun served Kaldemash as a powerful weapon, its most notable achievement was the accidental killing of one of Kaldemash's greatest friends. This death is what caused the regent to recognize the true destructive power of the star guns and led to him developing the Star Code, a set of rules of engagement and proper use of firearms still in use in Arcadia today. Although Kaldemash never named the weapon himself, all legends that mention the weapon refer to it as <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em>.</p>\n<p>The legendary weapon is a +3 major striking speed advanced firearm with a range increment of 90 feet. It deals 4d6 force damage (with the major striking rune included) and has the concealable, concussive, and fatal d10 traits. You don't take a penalty when dealing nonlethal damage with the weapon. Like most star guns, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> uses magic to function and doesn't require ammunition or black powder.</p>\n<p>If you use <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as part of a duel in which all parties are in agreement on the terms, the gun's supernatural instincts help you make the quickest draw. You roll twice and take the higher result on your initiative roll for the duel; this is a fortune effect. In addition, you can draw <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> as a free action at the start of your turn during the duel. If you attempt to fire the star gun in bad faith at a dueling opponent once they have surrendered, been defeated, or the duel is over, <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> flies out of your hand and you can't pick it up, hold it, or wield it for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">f</span> envision</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> You target a creature with an attack</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You adjust the damage that <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> deals before firing. <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em>'s damage type changes to either electricity, fire, or force until you change the type again.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You leave <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> to fire on its own. You release the star gun and it begins to move independently, flying through the air and firing. You still gain the benefits of the gun's speed rune while it's moving independently. It has a space of 5 feet but doesn't block or impede enemies attempting to move through that space. It always remains within 30 feet of you and intentionally resists being taken or otherwise moved; all attempts to Grab it fail. <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> moves this way for 3 rounds, after which it returns to your hand. If you don't have a free hand to hold it, the gun instead holsters itself on your person.</p>\n<p>While <em>Kaldemash's Lament</em> is moving independently, you can command it to make a Strike against a creature as an action, which has the concentrate trait. It makes a ranged Strike using your attack modifier while wielding it or a +31 bonus, whichever is higher. This attack increases your multiple attack penalty as normal, and the gun uses your multiple attack penalty when determining its attack bonus. Since the star gun is constantly moving and attempting to line up the appropriate shot, creatures it targets are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} to the gun's attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">3</span> envision, Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You unleash a barrage of attacks in an instant.

As a 10-minute activity, you can imprint one extended memory onto a node: the contents of a specific simple book, for example, or the events of a recent adventure. When you do, the node changes its shape and appearance to visually represent the memory you have imprinted onto it. If the node was already imprinted with a memory, the old one can be overwritten to repurpose the node.</p>\n<p>Memories you have imprinted on a node can be mentally accessed at any time by a creature holding the <em>memory palace</em> in its miniature form, regardless of who imprinted them. This grants a +2 item bonus to Recall Knowledge checks relating to details specifically occurring within the memory. What exactly qualifies is up to the GM's discretion, but a node shouldn't grant the benefits for most uses of a given skill. For example, a node dedicated to a book about trees found in the Mwangi Expanse would help with Recall Knowledge checks for such trees, but it wouldn't grant the benefits for all Nature checks to Recall Knowledge.</p>\n<p>A <em>memory palace</em> node can also store the text from a spellbook or magical tome, but these memories aren't a substitute for having the book in your possession. A wizard can't prepare spells from a <em>memory palace</em>, though they could use it as source material to try to Learn a Spell. However, since storing spells in a node would only benefit someone else who later discovers the memory palace, few choose to take such an action. The memories contained within the nodes aren't real, and thus don't cause harmful effects, even if the source of the memory was a mental danger.

More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre-Earthfall death cult that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen.</p>\n<p>An <em>oculus of Abaddon</em> appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills you with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes @Damage[4d6[bleed]] damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can be removed only by ripping it free (causing the same amount of persistent bleed damage as the initial plucking). When you place the oculus in your empty eye socket, you immediately heal all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus grants you constant @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pZTqGY1MLRjgKasV]{Darkvision}.

You also determine a password others must give the guard to bypass it. If a creature enters the area without giving the password, the sentry creates either an audible or mental alarm. An audible alarm has the sound and volume of a human shouting, as well as the auditory trait, allowing each creature that can hear it to attempt a @Check[perception|dc:15] check to wake up if they're asleep. The mental alert reaches you if you're within 60 feet of the active guard (see below).

It allows the bearer to use the aeon stone's resonant power and doesn't restrict the wearer from investing other aeon stones (even those slotted in a wayfinder). <em>St. Alkitarem's Eye</em> otherwise has the same statistics (including Price) as a wayfinder.</p>"

Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from <em>The Whispering Reeds</em> for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death—though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of <em>The Whispering Reeds</em>, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p><em>The Whispering Reeds</em> provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> command, Interact</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You read aloud a phrase from the book and target a single incorporeal undead creature within 30 feet.
